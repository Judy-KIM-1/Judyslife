# Judyslife
I am a Biomedical Data Analyst bridging wet-lab insights with Python visualization. My passion drives me toward RNA Therapeutics for cancer treatment and Neuro-Engineering, specifically designing devices based on the Gut-Brain Axis. I aim to solve intractable diseases by converging data, biology, and technology.
